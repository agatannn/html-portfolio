<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Agata, a passionate Front-End Web Developer who loves turning ideas into responsive, user-friendly websites.
  I specialize in crafting clean, modern interfaces with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.</p>

<p>With a keen eye for design and a strong focus on performance and accessibility, I enjoy creating digital 
  experiencesthat are not only beautiful but also intuitive and efficient. Whether it's building from scratch
  or collaborating with designers and back-end developers, I thrive on bringing interactive visions to life.</p>

<p>When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new design trends, sketching UI ideas, or diving into
  the latest front-end tools and technologies.</p>
<p>Let’s build something amazing together!</p>
